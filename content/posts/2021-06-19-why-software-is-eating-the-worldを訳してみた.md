テクノロジー企業について、最初はバブルかと思ってたけど、まだ続いている。そして、金銭的な価値もある。ことから、著者の理論は、
> we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy.
<br>(今はテクノロジー企業が経済の大部分を占める方向に向かっている最中ではないのか？)


> Perhaps the single most dramatic example of this phenomenon of software eating a traditional business is the suicide of Borders and corresponding rise of Amazon
<br>(それらを示す最もいい例はAmazonだ。)

> Today, the world’s largest bookseller, Amazon, is a software company — its core capability is its amazing software engine for selling virtually everything online, no retail stores necessary. On top of that, while Borders was thrashing in the throes of impending bankruptcy, Amazon rearranged its web site to promote its Kindle digital books over physical books for the first time. Now even the books themselves are software.
<br>(フィジカルな店舗いらない。最初は本を売ってたけどKindleが出てから、本自体もsoftwareになっちゃったしね。)

> Today’s largest video service by number of subscribers is a software company: Netflix. How Netflix eviscerated Blockbuster is an old story, but now other traditional entertainment providers are facing the same threat. Comcast, Time Warner and others are responding by transforming themselves into software companies with efforts such as TV Everywhere, which liberates content from the physical cable and connects it to smartphones and tablets.
Today’s dominant music companies are software companies, too: Apple’s iTunes, Spotify and Pandora. Traditional record labels increasingly exist only to provide those software companies with content. Industry revenue from digital channels totaled $4.6 billion in 2010, growing to 29% of total revenue from 2% in 2004.
Today’s fastest growing entertainment companies are videogame makers — again, software — with the industry growing to $60 billion from $30 billion five years ago. And the fastest growing major videogame company is Zynga (maker of games including FarmVille), which delivers its games entirely online. Zynga’s first-quarter revenues grew to $235 million this year, more than double revenues from a year earlier. Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, is expected to clear $100 million in revenue this year (the company was nearly bankrupt when it debuted the popular game on the iPhone in late 2009). Meanwhile, traditional videogame powerhouses like Electronic Arts and Nintendo have seen revenues stagnate and fall.
The best new movie production company in many decades, Pixar, was a software company. Disney — Disney! — had to buy Pixar, a software company, to remain relevant in animated movies.
<br>(映画、音楽、ゲームこれらの業界を牛耳っているのもSoftware. あのDisneyでさえ、Pixarというテクノロジー企業を買収しなければやっていけなかった。あのDisneyがだよ！)

そのほかにも、カメラ、石油、配達、支払いetc…　全部ソフトウェアが管理し始めている。


> It’s not an accident that many of the biggest recent technology companies — including Google, Amazon, eBay and more 
<br>(最初にも言ったけど、これら一連の出来事は、たまたま起きたものではない。)

> many people in the U.S. and around the world lack the education and skills required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the software revolution. This is a tragedy since every company I work with is absolutely starved for talent. Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment is sky high. 
<br>(このような新しいテクノロジーのスキルが備わっている人は少ない。追いついていない。)


> This problem is even worse than it looks because many workers in existing industries will be stranded on the wrong side of software-based disruption and may never be able to work in their fields again. There’s no way through this problem other than education, and we have a long way to go.
<br>
(っていうのは結構やばくて、今ソフトウェアと関係ない分野で働いている人は、二度とそこで働く事ができなくなる上に、ソフトウェアのスキルを習得するには長い時間を要するんだ。)


> That’s the big opportunity. I know where I’m putting my money.
<br>(これからも、もちろんソフトウェアにベットする。）
